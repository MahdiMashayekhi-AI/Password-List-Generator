# Password list with python!

This program for you creates a list of password lists that you can use for authentication and hacking :) I know it is very simple, but I will develop it for sure.

Copy this file to your project directory and run the terminal then you should give it a word or list of words finally you should see a file next to it and done!

Please help us in developing this program to make it more possible.
